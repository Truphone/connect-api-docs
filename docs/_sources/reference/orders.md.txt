# Orders

## Order Resource

SIM's and connectivity plans are purchased by creating orders. Order fulfilment is asynchronous due to the nature of SIM and network provisioning. Typical use cases include creating an order and polling for the status shortly after.

## Check an order's status

Order fulfilment is not synchronous, so after placing an order, the API user must use the order id to periodically check until the order is complete

- Allowed roles: `RESELLER`, `ACCOUNT_MANAGER`
- URL: `v1/order/{orderId}`
- METHOD: `GET`

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET \
